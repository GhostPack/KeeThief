<hr />

<p>KeePass stores your passwords securely in an encrypted file (database).
This database is locked with a master password, a key file and/or the
current Windows account details. To open a database, <b>all</b> key sources
(password, key file, ...) are <b>required</b>. Together, these key sources form the
<i>Composite Master Key</i>.</p>

<p>KeePass does not support keys being used alternatively, i.e. it's not possible
that you can open your database using a password <b>or</b> a key file. Either use
a password, a key file, or both at once (both required), but not interchangeably.</p>

<br />

<a name="password"></a>
<h2 class="sectiontitle">
<img src="../images/b16x16_password.png" class="singleimg" alt="Info" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Master
Passwords</h2>

<p>If you use a master password, you only have to remember one password or
passphrase (which should be good!) to open your database.
KeePass features protection
against brute-force and dictionary attacks on the master password,
read the <a href="security.html#secdictprotect">security information page</a>
for more about this.</p>

<p>If you forget this master password,
all your other passwords in the database are lost, too.
There isn't any backdoor or a key which can open all databases. There
is no way of recovering your passwords.</p>

<br />

<a name="keyfiles"></a>
<h2 class="sectiontitle">
<img src="../images/b16x16_file_locked.png" class="singleimg" alt="Info" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Key
Files</h2>

<p>You don't even have to remember a long,
complicated master passphrase. The database can also be
locked using a key file. A key file is basically a master password in a file.
Key files are typically stronger than master passwords, because the
key can be a lot more complicated; however it's also harder to keep them
secret.</p>

<ul>
<li>A key file can be used <i>instead</i> of a password, or in <i>addition</i> to a
password (and the Windows user account in KeePass 2.x).</li>
<li>A key file can be any file you choose; although you should choose one
with lots of random data.</li>
<li>A key file must not be modified, this will stop you opening the database.
If you want to use a different key file, you can change the master key and
use a new/different key file.</li>
<li>Key files must be backed up or you won't be able to open the database
after a hard disk crash/re-build. It's just the same as forgetting the
master password. There is no backdoor.<br />
<br />
Do not backup the key file to the same location as the database, use a
different directory or disk. Test opening your database on another machine
to confirm your backup works. For a detailed discussion on the difference
between backing up the key file and the database, see the
<a href="http://abp-keepass.sourceforge.net/FAQ.html" target="_blank">ABP FAQ</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Location.</b>
The point of a key file is that you <i>have</i> something to
authenticate with (in contrast to master passwords, where you
<i>know</i> something), for example a file on a USB stick.
The key file content (i.e. the key data contained within the key file)
needs to be kept secret.
The point is <i>not</i> to keep the location of the key file
secret &#8211; selecting a file out of thousands existing on your hard disk
basically doesn't increase
security at all, because it's very easy for malware/attackers to find out the
correct file (for example by observing the last access times of files,
the recently used files list of Windows, malware scanner logs, etc.).
Trying to keep the key file location secret is security by obscurity,
i.e. not really effective.</p>

<p><b>File Type and Existing Files.</b>
KeePass can generate key files for you, however you can also use any other,
already existing file (like JPG image, DOC document, etc.).</p>






In order to use an existing file as key file, click the 'Browse' button
in the master key creation dialog.

<h2 class="sectiontitle">
<img src="../images/b16x16_kdmconfig.png" class="singleimg" alt="Info" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows
User Account</h2>

<br />






KeePass can make the database dependent on the current Windows user
account. If you enable this option, you can only open the database when
you are logged in as the same Windows user when creating the database.<br />
<br />
<img src="../images/b16x16_warning.png" alt="Warning"
style="vertical-align: middle; height: 1em;" />
Be very careful with using this option. If your Windows user account
gets deleted, you won't be able to open your KeePass database anymore.
Also, when using this option at home and your computer breaks (hard disk
damaged), it is not
enough to just create a new Windows account on the new installation with the
same name and password;
you need to copy the <i>complete</i> account (i.e. SID, ...). This is not
a simple task, so if you don't know how to do this, it is highly recommended
that you don't enable this option.
Detailed instructions how to recover a Windows user account can be found here:
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/keepass/wiki/Recover%20Windows%20User%20Account%20Credentials/"
target="_blank">Recover Windows User Account Credentials</a>
(a short technical tutorial can be found in a Microsoft TechNet article:
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee681624%28WS.10%29.aspx"
target="_blank">How to recover a Vault corrupted by lost DPAPI keys</a>).<br />
<br />
You can change the password of the Windows user account freely;
this does not affect the KeePass database.
Note that <em>changing</em> the password (e.g. a user using the Control Panel
or pressing <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Del</kbd></kbd>
and selecting 'Change Password') and
<em>resetting</em> it to a new one (e.g. an administrator using a
<code>NET USER <i>&lt;User&gt;</i> <i>&lt;NewPassword&gt;</i></code>
command) are two different things.
After <em>changing</em> your password, you can still open your KeePass database.
When <em>resetting</em> the password to a new one, access usually is not possible
anymore (because the user's DPAPI keys are lost), but there are exceptions
(for example when the user is in a domain, Windows can retrieve the user's DPAPI keys
from a domain controller, or a home user can use a previously created
Password Reset Disk).
Details can be found in the MSDN article
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms995355.aspx"
target="_blank">Windows Data Protection</a> and in the support article
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/309408"
target="_blank">How to troubleshoot the Data Protection API (DPAPI)</a>.<br />
<br />
If you decide to use this option, it is highly recommended not to rely
on it exclusively, but to additionally use one of the other two options (password
or key file).<br />
<br />
<i>Protection using user accounts is unsupported on Windows 98 / ME.</i>

<h2 class="sectiontitle">
<img src="../images/b16x16_kdmconfig.png" class="singleimg" alt="Info" />&nbsp;&nbsp;For
Administrators: Specifying Minimum Properties of
Master Keys</h2>

<p>Administrators can specify a minimum length
and/or the minimum estimated quality that master passwords must have in
order to be accepted. You can tell KeePass
to check these two minimum requirements by adding/editing
appropriate definitions in the
<a href="configuration.html">INI/XML configuration file</a>.</p>






The contents of the <code>MinimumLength</code> node in
<code>Security/MasterPassword</code> can contain
the minimum master password length in characters. For example, by setting
the contents to <code>10</code>, KeePass will only accept
master passwords that have at least 10 characters.<br />
<br />
The contents of the <code>MinimumQuality</code> node in
<code>Security/MasterPassword</code> can contain
the minimum estimated quality in bits that master passwords must have. For example,
by setting the contents to <code>32</code>, only master passwords
with an estimated quality of at least 32 bits will be accepted.<br />
<br />
By specifying <code>KeyCreationFlags</code> and/or <code>KeyPromptFlags</code>
(in the <code>UI</code> node), you can force states (enabled, disabled,
checked, unchecked) of key source controls in the master key creation and
prompt dialogs. These values can be bitwise combinations of one or more of
the following flags:<br />
<br />
<table class="tablebox75">
<tr><th style="text-align: right">Flag (Hex)</th><th style="text-align: right">Flag (Dec)</th>
<th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: right">0x0</td><td style="text-align: right">0</td>
<td>Don't force any states (default).</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: right">0x1</td><td style="text-align: right">1</td>
<td>Enable password.</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: right">0x2</td><td style="text-align: right">2</td>
<td>Enable key file.</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: right">0x4</td><td style="text-align: right">4</td>
<td>Enable user account.</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: right">0x8</td><td style="text-align: right">8</td>
<td>Enable 'hide password' button.</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: right">0x100</td><td style="text-align: right">256</td>
<td>Disable password.</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: right">0x200</td><td style="text-align: right">512</td>
<td>Disable key file.</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: right">0x400</td><td style="text-align: right">1024</td>
<td>Disable user account.</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: right">0x800</td><td style="text-align: right">2048</td>
<td>Disable 'hide password' button.</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: right">0x10000</td><td style="text-align: right">65536</td>
<td>Check password.</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: right">0x20000</td><td style="text-align: right">131072</td>
<td>Check key file.</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: right">0x40000</td><td style="text-align: right">262144</td>
<td>Check user account.</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: right">0x80000</td><td style="text-align: right">524288</td>
<td>Check 'hide password' option/button.</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: right">0x1000000</td><td style="text-align: right">16777216</td>
<td>Uncheck password.</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: right">0x2000000</td><td style="text-align: right">33554432</td>
<td>Uncheck key file.</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: right">0x4000000</td><td style="text-align: right">67108864</td>
<td>Uncheck user account.</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: right">0x8000000</td><td style="text-align: right">134217728</td>
<td>Uncheck 'hide password' option/button.</td></tr>
</table>

<br />
The values of <code>KeyCreationFlags</code> and <code>KeyPromptFlags</code>
must be specified in decimal notation.<br />
<br />
For example, if you want to enforce using the user account option, you could
check and disable the control (such that the user can't uncheck it anymore)
by specifying 263168 as value (0x40000 + 0x400 = 0x40400 = 263168).
