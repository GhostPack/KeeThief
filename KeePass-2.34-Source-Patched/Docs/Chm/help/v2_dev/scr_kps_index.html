How to use KPS script files to automate KeePass 2.x.
</td></tr></table>

<p>KPS script files are a lot more powerful than single command operations,
but are also more complicated. You need
to have heavy experience in C# programming and the KeePass 2.x internals.
Within KPS files you can do everything that KeePass does.</p>

<p><b>What are KPS files?</b></p>

<p>KPS files are C# files that are loaded,
compiled and executed by the <code>KPScript.exe</code> program.
Within the script file, you got full access to the KeePass internals.</p>

<p>The main differences to &quot;normal&quot; C# files are:</p>

<ul>
<li>No need for <code>using</code> directives.</li>
<li>No need to add a reference to the KeePass assembly.</li>
<li>No need to write a wrapper class. Simply start with <code>Main()</code>. The
complete script file is embedded in a static class.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's the famous Hello World program as KPS script:</p>

<pre><font color="#0000FF">public static void</font> Main()
{
	<font color="#008888">MessageService</font>.ShowInfo(<font color="#880000">&quot;Hello World!&quot;</font>);
}</pre>

<p>For the most important namespaces, KPScript automatically adds
<code>using</code> directives at the start of the file before compiling it.
<code>MessageService</code> for example is located in <code>KeePassLib.Utility</code>,
but as it's included automatically by KPScript, you can use it directly.</p>

<hr />

<p><b>Executing a KPS file:</b></p>

<p>To run a KPS file, you simply pass it to KPScript:</p>

<pre>KPScript.exe C:\KeePass\MyScriptFile.kps</pre>

<p>It is important that the file extension is <code>.kps</code>, otherwise KPScript won't
recognize the file and will interpret it as database for single command operations.</p>
