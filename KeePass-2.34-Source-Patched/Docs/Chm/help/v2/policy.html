<p>Application policy is a KeePass feature that enables administrators
to prevent you from accidently compromising the security
system of your company.</p>

<p>Operations like exporting password entries to non-encrypted
files or printing for example can be prevented effectively
using the application policy.</p>

<p>If you are using KeePass at home, you can ignore the
application policy (everything allowed anyway) or reduce
your rights using the policy yourself, in order to avoid
accidental leakage of sensitive information.</p>

<p>In order to prevent changing the policy after it has
been specified, it is recommended to use an
<a href="../base/configuration.html">enforced configuration
file</a>.</p>

<p>KeePass can be installed on a network drive and a policy
can be enforced (like not permitting users to print the
password list).</p>

<p>The application policy enforcement is based on
the mechanism how KeePass stores configuration settings. You
first need to understand this method before you can continue
creating a policy:
<a href="../base/configuration.html">Configuration</a>.</p>

<p>A policy-enforcing KeePass installation looks like
the following: the KeePass application files are stored
on the network drive and all users are starting KeePass from
this drive (i.e. they only have links to the executable on
the network drive). By using an enforced configuration file
on the network drive
(remember that this file overrides all others),
a policy can be enforced.</p>

<p>In order to create such an installation, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>

<li>Copy KeePass to a common network drive, which supports
file permissions (like NTFS). All users must have access to
it.</li>

<li>Adjust the file permissions: allow users only to read and
execute all KeePass files, don't allow write access.</li>

<li>Adjust the file permissions for <code>KeePass.exe</code>:
only <i>Execute</i> must be allowed, all other permissions
should be disabled (including <i>Read</i> access).</li>

<li>Start KeePass. Open the <i>Options</i> dialog, switch to
the <i>Policy</i> tab and configure the policy. Exit KeePass.</li>

<li>Rename the <i>KeePass.config.xml</i> file to <i>KeePass.config.enforced.xml</i>.</li>

</ol>

<p>That's it. You created a policy that is enforced on all computers,
including your own one (until you change the enforced configuration file
on the network drive).</p>

Security</h2>

<p>Recall what the policy mechanism looks like: KeePass and the
configuration file are stored on the network drive. If you
grant your users free access to the internet or allow them
to insert CD-ROMs/DVDs/USB-Sticks, nothing prevents
a user to download a fresh copy of KeePass and run it. In
this case the policy isn't enforced, as the downloaded KeePass
doesn't know anything of the enforced configuration file on the network
drive.</p>

<p>Policy enforcement therefore only is effective if your users
really use the KeePass version installed on the network drive.</p>
