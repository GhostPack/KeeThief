  'Edit Notes.rtf' or click on the attachment in the entry view
  at the bottom of the main window; see 'How to store and work

2009-07-05: 2.08
- Key transformation library: KeePass can now use Windows'
  CNG/BCrypt API for key transformations (about 50% faster than
  the KeePass built-in key transformation code; by increasing
  the amount of rounds by 50%, you'll get the same waiting time
  as in 2.07, but the protection against dictionary and
  guessing attacks is raised by a factor of 1.5; only Windows
  Vista and higher)

- The password character picking dialog now supports pre-
  defining the number of characters to pick; append :k in the
  placeholder to specify a length of k (for example,

  having picked k characters, the dialog closes automatically,
  i.e. saves you to click [OK]

  anymore

  added later based on user requests, and can also be provided
  by plugins)
- Native master key transformations (rounds) are now computed
  by the native KeePassLibC support library (which contains the
  new, highly optimized transformation code used by KeePass
  1.15, in two threads); on dual/multi core processors this
  results in almost triple the performance as before (by
  tripling the amount of rounds you'll get the same waiting
  time as in 2.06, but the protection against dictionary and
  guessing attacks is tripled)
- Added recycle bin (enabled by default, it can be disabled in
  the database settings dialog)

  languages will be published on the KeePass translations page
  when translators finish them)
- When saving the database, KeePass now first checks whether
